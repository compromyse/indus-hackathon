There exist habitats on the Moon. The habitats are equipped with sensors for temperature, pressure, etc. You are alotted a certain amount of each resource, like water or oxygen, for each habitant in the habitat. However, if you want to buy more of said resources, you will need to buy more from the store, on the dashboard.
